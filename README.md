# Pivterdash

A dashboard to track git merges and pivotal cards

Phase 1: Learn how to query the Pivotal project via its API. Create a
useful report to help with the merge process.

Phase 2: There are a finite number of states in which a card can exist. When 
a card is moved, update the labels to reflect the bin in which the card
is placed.

Phase 3: Create a rich client application to help with the sorting
process.
